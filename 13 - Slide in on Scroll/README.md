# Day 13 - Slide in on Scroll

**Completed on:** _10/26/2019_

---

## Things Learned:

-   A _debounce_ function is useful to prevent your function from running multiple times per second
-   `window.scrollY` shows how many pixels from the top you are scrolling
-   `window.innerHeight` shows the current VH in pixels
-   `element.offsetTop` displays the pixels from the top of the site to the top of the element
